# Anwesha
Anwesha is a quest. The annual Techno-Cultural Festival of Indian Institute of Technology Patna hosts Technical, Cultural, Literary, Eco and Management events. Since its genesis in 2010, Anwesha has gained great importance at an exponential rate and enjoys a cult status among the youths of Bihar. Eminent personalities such as chief minister Nitish Kumar, Padma Vibhushan, G. Madhavan Nair, R.K. Sihna (Dolphin Man of India), have been part of Anwesha's extravaganza in the past.
